Allow filtering(unpredictable performance)
	PRIMARY KEY ((title, added_year), video_id)
	just title/year
	
We try to filter only by title it means that neccessary records can be
in all partitions. That is way we receive message "allow filtering", case 
performance of query can be unefficient. If we don't worry about unefficient
performance we can add "ALLOW FILTERING" to the end of our query and it 
will be performed.

	EXAMPLE:
PRIMARY KEY((col1, col2), col5, col4))

We can filter by next rule:
	Necessary => all fields from PARTITION KEY
			  => if we want to add column from CLUSTERED KEY,
			  all other columns which are before it must be
			  added to

Valid:
	col1 and col2
	col1 and col2 and col5
	col1 and col2 and col5 and col4
Invalid:
	col1 and col2 and col4
	anything that does not contain both col1 and col2
	
Exception is situation when were created any secondary indexes.
